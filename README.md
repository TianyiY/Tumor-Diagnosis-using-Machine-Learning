project description: 
 - In this project, I am trying to diagnose the breast tumor as ‘malignant’ or ‘benign’ based
   on the patients’ physical examination datasets (geometry of the tumors), as well as the
   diagnostic results (labeled as ‘malignant’ or ‘benign’). This problem is frequently  
   occurring in diseases diagnosis. 
 
required softwares and packages:
 - jupyter notebook
